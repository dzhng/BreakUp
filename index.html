<h1>Dear Internet Explorer,</h1>
	
<p>
Sorry, But We Can't Do This Anymore.

<p>
No, it's not you! It's me! I swear! You see, you've just become <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/01/bootstrapped-startup-saves-over-100k-by-dropping-ie/">too expensive for me.</a> 
Sure, you were <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/IE7-and-Firefox-2-0-Are-Slaughtering-Internet-Explorer-6-77994.shtml">popular back then</a>, 
but you've really been <a href="http://apcmag.com/can_ies_architect_explain_why_its_so_bloated.htm">gaining a lot of weight lately</a>. 
Yea, I know you've been working hard to <a href="http://dottech.org/freeware-reviews/21818/">get back in shape</a>, 
and you're also planning on going through with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_10">plastic surgery</a>, but I just think it's too little, too late.
</p>

<p>
If it makes you feel better, here's a ticket to a <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> 
you can go on with your sexy friend <a href="http://www.firefox.com/">Foxy</a>. Who knows, maybe you'll finally find <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">the one</a>.
